Ryokushi:……Once I catch the\xfffePokémon Urugamosu in this castle,\xf000븀\x0000I'll present it to Lord Getis.\xf000븀\x0000Or so I planned..\xf000븁\x0000but isn't even the Dark Trinity\xfffesaying that Lord Getis\xf000븀\x0000has hidden away somewhere…?\xf000븁\x0000
The Seven Sages……\xf000븁\x0000And when all seven are gathered,\xfffethey are perfect…\xf000븁\x0000I don't know what those\xfffewords really mean anymore.\xf000븁\x0000I can understand their use, but\xfffeI can no longer see the dream.\xf000븁\x0000
I don't need this anymore.\xf000븁\x0000Lord Getis gave it to me,\xfffebut I have no intentions for it.\xf000븁\x0000
Ryokushi: Both this Ancient Castle and\xfffeour castle have crumbled…\xf000븁\x0000The only difference is that the\xfffeAncient Castle is the remains of\xf000븁\x0000a civilization……\xf000븁\x0000Nothing of our castle\xfffewas left behind……\xf000븁\x0000
Looker: Alright, then……\xfffeI'm an international policeman,\xf000븁\x0000so tell me what you know\xfffeabout Team Plasma!\xf000븁\x0000
