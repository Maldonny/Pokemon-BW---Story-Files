Kagome Town\xfffeA peacefully-constructed triangle!
This is Kagome Town...\xf000븁\x0000Where people live properly\xfffefrom good morning to good night...\xf000븁\x0000When we live bathing\xfffein the light of the sun,\xf000븀\x0000we sleep soundly in the night.
Just a second, traveler!\xfffeWant me to tell you\xf000븀\x0000about the history of Kagome Town?\xf000븁\x0000As an old woman's tale,\xfffeit might get a little long...
There is a very, very large\xfffehole under this town.\xf000븁\x0000That hole was formed long, long ago,\xfffewhen a great meteor fell from the sky.\xf000븁\x0000And in the meteor, there lurked\xfffea most fearful beast...\xf000븁\x0000It is said the beast would appear at\xfffenight, bringing a cold wind with it,\xf000븀\x0000and take people and Pokémon alike...\xf000븀\x0000to devour them!\xf000븁\x0000So the ancient people built\xfffea wall to keep the beast out.\xf000븁\x0000And to stay inside when the sun\xfffewas set became a law of the town...\xf000븁\x0000
... ... ... ... ...\xfffeWell, no one really believes\xf000븀\x0000in such a tale anymore.\xf000븁\x0000However...\xf000븁\x0000To this day, the people of Kagome\xfffealways make sure to get home\xf000븀\x0000at night... curious, isn't it?\xf000븁\x0000Just how much of our lives today\xfffeis influenced by legends and tradition?
Ah, I see...\xfffeIf you have time, do come again!
When night falls, a big bad\xfffemonster comes out of the hole,\xf000븀\x0000so you better just come home!
Wow... What a beautiful town...\xfffeI just like the old-fashioned towns.\xf000븁\x0000You know? The towns with the\xfffeamazing stories and old looks!
Hmmm...\xfffeYeah, I really like that story.\xf000븀\x0000I don't know why, but I like\xf000븀\x0000that story! I just... Like it!
What am I doing here?\xfffeI'm just thinking of my husband...\xf000븀\x0000He disappeared all of a sudden...
Hey there!\xfffeDid you listen to the town elder?\xf000븁\x0000She has a beautiful but scary\xfffestory to tell you! Check it out!
Goo-goo! Goo-goo!
My Pokémon always go off\xfffeto play on their own...
